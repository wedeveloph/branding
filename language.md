The expressiveness, tone, and mood we set by Developh's copy.

## In examples


* On Projects * 

* Peter De Guzman sees a 7th grader at a computer shop trying to fill out a learner and enrollment survey. "No budget for internet or data, no mobile phone/PC/tablet, parents are at home with no work." He provides an additional 5 pesos (0.10USD) since the student is running out of time on the PC. / The government's response to online schooling is appalling. The class gap continues to widen. Schools are underfunded and underresourced. This is a reality faced by countless students in the Philippines, and we need to act. #NoStudentLeftBehind


* Calls to Action * 

* With a rise in new movements and desires to get involved, we want to build a hub for students to connect with organizations and causes close to their hearts. Today, we're expanding Cause.ph to be a directory for youth-led movements and organizations working towards a breadth of different advocacies. âœŠðŸŒˆ / Organization leaders, list your movement at bit.ly/cause-orgsignup! Like Cause.ph to get updated about the list and ways to involve yourself in movements from mental health to the arts to equitable education.
