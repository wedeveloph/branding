Hey! Here are our logos; get in touch with us if you need to use them or pick them up from here if we've agreed on them. PNGs and JPEGs are up for download but if you're in need of other formats or have questions, don't hesitate to email us.



## Logo Usage

The Developh logo is always presented with both its icon and wordmark.

In cases where the full logo is too long for a pubmat/collateral, only the icon is used. However, this is only allowed when the Developh name is already evident (i.e. a pubmat on our own social media page). For external media (partners/sponsors), please use the full logo. 

Whether with wordmark or without wordmark, the logo must always have a healthy amount of whitespace around it. This means that other elements (e.g. logos) must not be in proximity of it. Basically, the logo has to be able to breathe; if anything is too close to it, it will suffocate.

The logo is only allowed to be presented in shades of blue, black, and white. The background color should be high-contrast to the color it is presented in.
